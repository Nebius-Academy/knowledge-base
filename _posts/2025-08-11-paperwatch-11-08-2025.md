While autoregressive generative models we use so happily are quite cool, one of their prominent weaknesses is self-assessment. An LLM might be able to create a solution for a hard mathematical problem, but it would struggle to understand whether this solution is correct or not. Looks like we had to trade part of the discriminative power in favour of generative prowess.
